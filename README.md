Homework 2 Part 1: Convolutional Neural Networks
Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using Numpy, without using any deep learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. The focus is on understanding the fundamentals of CNNs, including forward and backward propagation through convolutional, pooling, and resampling layers.

Key Features
Implemented 1D and 2D Convolutional Layers.
Developed Pooling Layers (Max and Mean).
Implemented Resampling (Upsampling and Downsampling).
Backpropagation through all layers, including convolution and pooling.
Built and trained complete CNN models for image and sequence data.


Structure
mytorch/nn/: Contains CNN components (Conv1d.py, Conv2d.py, pool.py, etc.).
mytorch/models/: Contains the code for building and training CNN models.
